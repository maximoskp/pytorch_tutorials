Simple tutorials on basics of pytorch.

MNIST linear and conv2d:

Done:
- MNIST with single layer and weight visualization
- MNIST with two layers. TODO: use softmax at the end
- CNN MNIST. Visualize filters?
In all the above, add test set evaluation, possibly as a validation set.

For the FF AE, include encoder and decoder in the ff module.
At some point, FF and CNN might need to get their own submodules,
with their own encoder and decoder submodules?

TODO:
- AE FF MNIST.
- AE CNN MNIST.
- VAE CNN MNIST.
- VQVAE CNN MNIST.
- GANs CNN MNIST.
